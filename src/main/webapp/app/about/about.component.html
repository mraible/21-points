          In late September through mid-October 2014, I'd done a
          <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/the_21_day_sugar_detox"> 21-Day Sugar Detox</a> during which I stopped eating sugar,
          started exercising regularly, and stopped drinking alcohol. I'd had high blood pressure for over 10 years and was on
          blood-pressure medication at the time. During the first week of the detox, I ran out of blood-pressure medication. Since a new
          prescription required a doctor visit, I decided I'd wait until after the detox to get it. After three weeks, not only did I lose
          15 pounds, but my blood pressure was at normal levels!
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I started the detox, I came up with a 21-point system to see how healthy I was being each week. Its rules were simple: you
          can earn up to three points per day for the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>If you eat healthy, you get a point. Otherwise, zero.</li>
          <li>If you exercise, you get a point.</li>
          <li>If you don't drink alcohol, you get a point.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I was surprised to find I got eight points the first week I used this system. During the detox, I got 16 points the first week, 20
          the second, and 21 the third. Before the detox, I thought eating healthy meant eating anything except fast food. After the detox,
          I realized that eating healthy for me meant eating no sugar. I'm also a big lover of craft beer, so I modified the alcohol rule to
          allow two healthier alcohol drinks (like a greyhound or red wine) per day.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to earn 15 points per week. I find that if I get more, I'll likely lose weight and have good blood pressure. If I get
          fewer than 15, I risk getting sick. I've been tracking my health like this since September 2014. I've lost 30 pounds and my blood
          pressure has returned to and maintained normal levels. I haven't had good blood pressure since my early 20s, so this has been a
          life changer for me.
