                    In late September through mid-October 2014, I'd done a <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/the_21_day_sugar_detox">
                    21-Day Sugar Detox</a> during which I stopped eating sugar, started exercising regularly, and stopped drinking
                    alcohol. I'd had high blood pressure for over 10 years and was on blood-pressure medication at the time. During
                    the first week of the detox, I ran out of blood-pressure medication. Since a new prescription required a doctor
                    visit, I decided I'd wait until after the detox to get it. After three weeks, not only did I lose 15 pounds,
                    but my blood pressure was at normal levels!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before I started the detox, I came up with a 21-point system to see how healthy I was being each week. Its rules
                    were simple: you can earn up to three points per day for the following reasons:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If you eat healthy, you get a point. Otherwise, zero.</li>
                    <li>If you exercise, you get a point.</li>
                    <li>If you don't drink alcohol, you get a point.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    I was surprised to find I got eight points the first week I used this system. During the detox, I got 16 points
                    the first week, 20 the second, and 21 the third. Before the detox, I thought eating healthy meant eating anything
                    except fast food. After the detox, I realized that eating healthy for me meant eating no sugar. I'm also a big
                    lover of craft beer, so I modified the alcohol rule to allow two healthier alcohol drinks (like a greyhound or
                    red wine) per day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal is to earn 15 points per week. I find that if I get more, I'll likely lose weight and have good blood
                    pressure. If I get fewer than 15, I risk getting sick. I've been tracking my health like this since September
                    2014. I've lost 30 pounds and my blood pressure has returned to and maintained normal levels. I haven't had good
                    blood pressure since my early 20s, so this has been a life changer for me.
